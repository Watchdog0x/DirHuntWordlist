# DirHuntWordlist

## Description

DirHuntWordlist is a specialized wordlist designed for discovering hidden directories and paths on web servers and file systems. This wordlist is a valuable asset for penetration testers, security researchers, and ethical hackers who want to uncover concealed or less-accessible areas within web applications and file structures.

## Wordlist

The primary wordlist file in this repository is `dirhuntwordlist.txt`, which contains a carefully curated list of directory and path names. These names are specifically chosen to aid in the efficient and comprehensive enumeration of directories and paths during security assessments and vulnerability scanning.

## List Of Extensions
